# Wynncraft Weapon Bigger

![WynnWeaponBiggerBanner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/443188e9-20e3-4aa0-a001-60ad3e3daa22)


I make your weapon big, duh. A fork of [Big Items, Duh](https://modrinth.com/mod/big-items-duh) designed to only show Wynncraft gear and updated to 1.21. This will be more useful once CITResewn updates. Made for my modpack [World of Wynncraft](https://modrinth.com/modpack/world-of-wynncraft)

## What's Up

- Zoom in on Wynncraft gear in your inventory
- Configurable zoom scale and position
- Toggle gear zoom functionality with a keybind
- Uses Wynntils mod to detect Wynncraft weapons and gear
- Tooltips always display on top of zoomed weapons
- Works great with [Immersive UI](https://modrinth.com/mod/immersive-ui)

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
2. Download and install version 2.1.1 or later of Wynntils
3. Download the latest version of Wynncraft Weapon Bigger from the versions page
4. Place the downloaded .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder

## Future Features

- Special effects for shiny and mythic items
- Wynntils item borders
- Suggest features on the GitHub issues page!

## Configuration

You can configure WWB through the Mod Menu interface or config file:

1. Install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) if you haven't already.
2. In the game, go to Mods -> Find "Wynn Weapon Bigger" -> Click "Configure".
3. Adjust settings such as zoom scale, position, and toggle message visibility.
4. Toggle weapon, armor, accessory, and un-id box zoom separately.

## Usage

- Hover over a Wynncraft weapon in your inventory to see it zoomed in.
- The zoomed view will disappear when you move your cursor away from the weapon.
- Use the configured keybind (default: period key) to toggle the zoom functionality on/off. (Currently, hotkeys don't work in inventories. This is a Minecraft bug)
- Access the mod's configuration through Mod Menu to adjust zoom scale, position, and other settings.
